# VARK-MBTI
Web application.

## What does it do?
Applies VARK/MBTI tests to students to show which learning strategies are best for them, along with their main personality traits.
Admins and teachers can see general results graphically and get Excel and PDF reports.

## You should know...
This is an **extremely** rushed school project, has a **TON** of W.E.T., D.R.Y., nasty hard-coded stuff, and it may not be updated in the future at all.
Oh, and you could probably tell by the commits but the whole thing is in Spanish.

Works well for the most part though, so don't be scared to give it a try.
